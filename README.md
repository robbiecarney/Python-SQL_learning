This repository contains my completed Jupyter Notebooks from the Coursera courses Python for Data Science, AI & Development (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-applied-data-science-ai) and Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python (https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science), both from IBM.
